### Phase 1 - Command lime application

This project was a school assignment. Students were tasked with creating a database management system.
I based my database management system on my hobby of LEGO. The project simulated the software development 
process. The files I've attached are Phase 1 of the project. Getting the logic and validation accurate.

### Phase 2  Unit Testing
In Phase 2 of the project, I created a test file containing unit tests for the primary actions the user will 
perform when the program is run. Analyzing the expected and actual output when the method is called.
Fixing issues that were previously there.

### Phase 3 Website GUI Application
In Phase 3, students were tasked to create a Graphical User Interface of the command-line application for 
users to interact with. I created a small HTML website that allows users to perform CRUD operations and
custom action. Each webpage allows them to fill out a form with the necessary details to see or manipulate
their Lego set or collection.

### Phase 4 Connecting to a database
In Phase 4, students had to establish a connection database. For this portion, I have used SQLite to create a
database called LegoCollection with a table named LegoSet. Students had to alter the application so that when the 
user wants to complete a CRUD operation or a custom action, it simultaneously changes or reflects the database.
